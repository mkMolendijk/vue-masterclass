# Exercise 9

Experiment with the [composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/)

- Use `setup()` in your component and see if it works
- Convert `data()` into state in `setup()`
- Convert the methods into functions in your `setup()`
- Seperate your messages logic into a `useMessages()` function outside of your component
